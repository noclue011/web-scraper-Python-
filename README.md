## General Information
This is a simple web scraper that is made using Python. The project consists of 2 python files. "web-scraper(testing).py" is a test file that I created to help learn some of the functionality that is available in python, while "scraper.py" contains the actual web scraper. The web scraper program pulls the 7 day forecast for San Francisco from weather.gov and displays the forecast to the user. It pulls the period, short description, temperature, and full description for each part of the forecast.

I undertook this project as a tutorial to learn the basics of Python.


## Technologies Used
* Python 3.10.2
